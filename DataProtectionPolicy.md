# Telos Blockchain Network Data Protection Policy

## Introduction

Telos is a network of decentralised and autonomous entities known as participants, as defined in the Telos Blockchain Network Operators Agreement (TBNOA) document. From hereon, Telos will be referred to as the Telos Blockchain Network (TBN). Its Participants may include, but are not limited to, users, businesses, application developers, block producers and other entities that the TBN has a relationship with.

## Policy Summary

1. The TBN provides a public blockchain service. A public blockchain, by definition, is a public service that is open to all participants.

2 .Data provided by network participants is recorded by Block Producers on the TBN, and hence is public - visible to all participants and nonparticipants alike. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the network participants themselves, to recognize and understand they  are in control of their data, and hence need to comply with the relevant data protection laws and process the data in a manner that applies to their individual use cases, and is in compliance with their individual regulatory requirements

3. The TBN requires all Block Producers to take the necessary measures to ensure the immutability, integrity and availability of the data recorded on the Telos blockchain, who may be subject to service level agreements with one or more TBN participants, but are not responsible for the confidentiality of the data.

4. The TBN does not have any employees.

5. This policy only applies to the TBN. Any future blockchain networks that may connect to the TBN shall be responsible for their own policy.

6. This policy will be reviewed annually by the TBN.
