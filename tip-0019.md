# Abstract

Upon launch, the Telos Blockchain Network Operating Agreement calls for approximately 140 million TLOS to be allocated to an Exchange Token Reserve Fund (ETRF). TIP 19 proposes a “claim it or lose it” policy, such that exchanges have one full calendar year post-launch to enable support for TLOS.

# Motivation

The ETRF should motivate exchanges to quickly enable support for TLOS.

# Rationale

Facing a deadline, exchanges will be more likely to act. Additionally, users on the exchanges who held EOS will put pressure on the exchanges to enable support for Telos. A smart contract will ensure that on the one year anniversary of Telos’ mainnent launch, any remaining tokens in the ETRF will be burnt.

# Specification

Modify text in paragraph 22 of the Telos Blockchain Network Operating Agreement (TBNOA) to read as follows:

    “The Telos Exchange Token Reserve Fund will receive ____ TLOS tokens, which may be distributed to exchanges that enable support for TLOS within one calendar year after the launch of the Telos mainnent.”
