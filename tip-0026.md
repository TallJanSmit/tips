# Abstract
 
Propose a cap of 5 TFVT for a fair and equitable distribution of Telos Foundation Voter Tokens (TFVT) based on the pie slicing app.


# Motivation

As it is now, the larger slices will receive 10 TFVT, and it is broken into 10 percentile groups. We would like it broken up into 5 percentile groups making for a much closer vote potential from lowest to highest, this will empower everyone to vote and recognize their vote has value.

# Rational

We want the Telos Foundation to be a tight knit group, and this will help along those lines by decreasing the number of TFVT
the larger pie slices would receive.

# Specification

That the pie slicing app participants be split into 5 groups with the smallest group getting one TFVT and the largest group 
getting 5 TFVT
