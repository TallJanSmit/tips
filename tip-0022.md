# Abstract

We need TLOS to buy ram for initial account creation for genesis load

# Motivation

There is a cost to create accounts that has to be accounted for and transferred to the eosio account.

# Rational

Account creation is not free and the TLOS needed needs to be accounted for. In the launch practice we use almost 20000 to create
the genesis account, and stil have to create the community rewards accounts and the Telos Foundation Launch group accounts.

# Specifications

25000 TLOS to be added to the eosio account for all account creation and any leftover funds to be transferred to 
eosio.savings, which is the worker proposal fund.
