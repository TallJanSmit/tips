Abstract
---------

This TIP is dependent on the approval/passing of either TIP 24 or 
the equivalent TIP 28 (Provision 1).

Octagon Labs proposes that a cap is introduced on any single entity or 
team at an agreed percentage share of the  Telos Foundersâ€™ Reward 
Pool of 12 million tokens.

Motivation
-----------

Since its conception back in July 2018, the Telos project attracted a 
large number of contributors to Good Block's excellent initiative.

TIP 24 recognises this fact and aims to reward those additional contributors 
for their hard work but falls short of it's objective by not taking into 
account the current slicing-pie model.

Rational
---------

Of the estimated total number of 300 million Telos tokens, 18 million 
is to be awarded to contributers who have worked tirelessly on the succesful 
launch of the Telos Blockchain Network. 

- 100% of the 18 million tokens is equivilent to 6% of the total supply.
- 75% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 4.5% of the total supply.
- 66% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 4.0% of the total supply.
- 50% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 3.0% of the total supply.

The rational for creating Telos is to provide a DPoS network where token 
holders are given a second opportunity for the EOS community to participate
more effectively and establish a wider circle of trust through fairer 
distribution.

I encourage all Telos launch controibuters to apply the spirit of 
"fair distribution" to themselves as well as others, as the launch date 
approaches, to start with a trustworthy foundation for future Telos 
participents to build on.


Discussion
-----------

The Telos Launch Group to consider the above example percentages and agree on a 
limit/cap per entity on the share of the Telos Founders' Reward Pool.

(Discussion period is open.)
