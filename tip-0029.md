Abstract
---------

This TIP is dependent on the approval/passing of either TIP 24 or 
the equivalent TIP 28 (Provision 1).

Octagon Labs proposes that a cap is introduced on any single entity or 
team at an agreed percentage share of the  Telos Foundersâ€™ Reward 
Pool of 12 million tokens.

Motivation
-----------

Since its conception back in July 2018, the Telos project attracted a 
large number of contributors to Good Block's excellent initiative.

TIP 24 and TIP 28 (Provision 1) recognise this fact and aims to reward those 
additional contributors for their hard work but falls short of it's 
objective by not taking into account the current slicing-pie model.

While we fully recognise Good Block's initiative and their commitment 
to the success of the Telos project, we would also like to recognise the 
contributions of the expanded team which quadrupled in size since inception. 
 

Rational
---------

We wish to have the spirit of Telos' fair drop to the wider EOS community 
to also apply here.

Of the estimated total number of 300 million Telos tokens: 

- 75% of 12 million tokens is equivalent to 3% of the total.
- 50% of 12 million tokens is equivalent to 2% of the total.
- 25% of 12 million tokens is equivalent to 1% of the total.

- 75% of 15 million tokens is equivalent to 3.75% of the total.
- 50% of 15 million tokens is equivalent to 2.50% of the total.
- 25% of 15 million tokens is equivalent to 1.25% of the total.


The rational for creating Telos is to reduce the influence of whales
and to provide a second opportunity for the EOS community to participate
more effectively and establish a wider circle of trust through fairer 
distribution.

 
Discussion
-----------

The Telos Launch Group to consider the above example percentages and agree on a 
limit/cap per entity on the share of the Telos Founders' Reward Pool.

(Discussion period is open.)
