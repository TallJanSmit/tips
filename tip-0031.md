# ABSTRACT

We will need to have a very small amount of TLOS in each community rewards account on 
creation so a transaction can be made.

# MOTIVATION

The bounty-system work group would like the accounts created along with all the other accounts on injection
so the system can buy the RAM needed to create the account, however they will not know for some time before 
the rewards will be distributed.

# RATIONALE

On injection the community rewards will not be established, however they want the accounts created so the 
transfer can be made at a later date.

# SPECIFICATIONS

We would to propose that we create each account with 1 TLOS staked (.9 CPU and .1 NET). The totl cost would be 250 TLOS - it has been reccomended that this 250 TLOS be subtracted from the community rewards pool

# DISCUSSION

Open for discussion.
